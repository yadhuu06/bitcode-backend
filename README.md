#  BitCode Backend

**Dropping the code. Raising the stakes.**

This is the official backend for **BitCode**â€”a real-time competitive programming battle platform powered by Django, Django Channels, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Judge0 for instant code execution.

---

##  1. Overview

BitCode enables real-time, head-to-head coding battles with features such as:
- Live battle rooms (1v1, squads, teams) with instant result evaluation.
- Dynamic lobby creation, joining, and chatting via WebSockets.
- Persistent **Elo-based seasonal rankings** to track skill growth across competitive seasons.
- **Community-driven question contributions** so users can submit new coding challenges.
- A **custom compiler service** supporting **Python, Go, and JavaScript**, built for faster, sandboxed execution.
- Secure account management with email + Google OAuth.
- Scalable architecture with Redis for caching and message brokering.
- Cloud-native media handling using ImageKit.
